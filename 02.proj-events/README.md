# :rocket: A Practical Session Based on Next Routing

The goal of the session was to show how to implement NextJs routing features.

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

- Folder based routing
- Dynamic routing
- Catch all dynamic routing

## :bookmark_tabs: Footnotes

- There is nothing new about the project. The only different, we are using NextJs paradigms of code structure, and file based routing. The rest of the code, the componets, it's all React and javascript. Even the pages themselves.

- The entry point of the next js project is \_app.js. The funny thing about it, is that it can be placed anywhere. For instance, by mistake, I moved it into a components folder/events and it was working fine (Bad practices - I had to use finder to locate it). I guess the most important thing in a NextJs App, is that, it should be always defined regardless of where you place it.
