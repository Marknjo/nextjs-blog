# :rocket: NextJS Lab

## :balloon: Overview

This is a simple setup for exercising NextJs. This is not project specific. Just want to keep track of the code I learn.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Start Next JS in a Production Server.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run dev`

Starts NextJs in Development mode
