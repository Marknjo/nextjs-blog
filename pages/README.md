The section is all about understanding NextJs API routing feature.

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

- the whole idea of API routing is more the same as file based routing. The way you difine your api routes it is similar to the way you define your app URL.
- The only different with the code in the api routes, is that it is server side. Meaning, it is all NodeJs.
- One thing that was super powerful in this section is how to read and access some sile stored in the root folder using node js fs (file system). It is such a breeze.
- When it comes to POST and other Restful methods, they are handled as if it is an api end.
- However, when carrying server side pre-rendering, you don't use fetch as the way you'll do when accessing external api. Here you inport necessary methods required to carryout the fetching and data manipulation. It's super intuitive.
