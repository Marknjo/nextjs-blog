# :rocket: Project to reinforce Data Fetching with Next Js Concccepts

This proejct is based on the previous one, which we were fetchin events from a dummy data. The aim was to refactor the code to fetch data from a backend, so as to reinforce the data fetching with NextJs concepts.

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

There is less to say about this module, this is because it was all about reinforcing the concepts learnt on the Data fetching lessons. However, the instructor illustrated how to implement server side pre-rendering and client side. For instance, the filtering page [...slug], is the page which serch engines do not need to know about. Therefore, event is he illustrated how to pre-render data using the getServerSideProps, because of the multiple url params, later along we refactored the code to fetch data on the fly as user requests it (filtering happens). Kinda the right way because we won't have the need to populate the page with the data.

## :bookmark_tabs: Footnotes

One thing that I have noted, my linter doesn't seem to lint quite efficient as it does while working on React projects.

Secondly, am not sure whether it is because I am always running the `npm run dev` script, I find that the app is really sluggish. It's not comparable as developing the app in the react environment.
