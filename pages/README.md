# :rocket: API Routing Practicals With Next Events App

The agenda of this exercise was to put into practice the skills learnt on the nextjs server API lesson.

## :balloon: Skills Gained in the Session

The practice rainforced my next skills on working with data collection, saving, and fetching. Also, separation of concerns, front and backend. I kinda felt the punch of mixing the front and server side code.

## :bookmark_tabs: Footnotes

I did try the section all by myself. It was tough to remember everything. Painful as it is to dubug petty bugs caused by typo. My worst was trying to access server side on the React components. It's laughable because I could not understand why I was getting this error "nextjs: Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'", yet it seems I have done everything alright. It is a hard lesson I have learned, never try to learn server side code on the client side. I am glad it happened as early as now. I even found a solution on Google. Maybe the rest do not recognize this challenge.

I happened to solve my solution by writing to the json files stored on the local path, while the tutor used the MongoDB database. I kinda felt I needed to grasp the concepts here.

Generally, the exercise challenged my mind well enough.
